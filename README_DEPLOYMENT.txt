The files to be uploaded to the CTF server are in one folder labelled "upload to CTF server (clean code and instructions)", EXCLUDING the README file.

ALL OTHER FILES CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION (DO NOT UPLOAD) such as the challenge codes with the FLAGs, updated WRITEUP, SOLVER attack script, first challenge SOLUTION and the README for RUNNING. These are meant for the BACKEND ONLY.

Please run the challenge code with FLAG named "12065.py" and "31173.py" in the folder labelled "run on CTF server DO NOT UPLOAD (source code with FLAG)" on the CTF server for challengers to attempt.

An example of what challengers would see is
MAC & CHEESE SOUP
<12065 instructions.txt>
nc address 12065
<sanitised_12065.py>, <Instructions for second challenge.txt>, <sanitised_second_challenge.py>
ONLY.

***IMPORTANT***
PLEASE DO NOT RELEASE PORT NUMBER 31173 since we will release it as information from the FLAG of the FIRST MINI-CHALLENGE.
***************
