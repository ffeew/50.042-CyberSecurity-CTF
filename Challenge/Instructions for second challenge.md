## Challenge Description

Last month, our overzealous rookie security engineers at Campbell Soup Security Pte. Ltd. decided to implement their own upgraded version of ElGamal in an oracle to encrypt our super secret patented Campbell Soup Security recipe (FLAG).

They used some new-fangled system that they found through a link on the ElGamal encryption Wikipedia page as a guide to build the oracle, but looks like they put more effort into the graphics than actually following the system. Sigh.

Unsurprisingly, we have received reports that an anonymous actor is continuously trying to decrypt our super secret patented Campbell Soup Security recipe using this rookie oracle.

Therefore, we have put the oracle under maintenance and our valued customers may only decrypt their own stocked up soup recipes for the time being. Of course, employees are still welcome to read our super secret patented Campbell Soup Security recipe.

Which brings us to today. It is with a heavy heart that we announce our imminent failure in securing our super secret patented Campbell Soup Security recipe. Despite our best efforts, we are seeing an increase of suspicious traffic in high volumes at perfectly precise intervals, and our senior security engineers tell us that the anonymous actor is minutes away from succeeding...
