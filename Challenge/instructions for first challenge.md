# Welcome to Scam the Server

## Instructions for first challenge

This challenge is the precursor to our main challenge, its flag will be the port number of our main challenge.

In this challenge, you will be given a message and a MAC. You will need to scam the server into returning you a flag by sending to it a message that contains a magic word.

The server checks if the MAC matches with the message as well so simply modifying the message to the server will not work :p

The original message is: VDU=
The original MAC is: fb92d54b2136c756ee80b2d2d8fd925ceccd09f4

MAC is generated by: MAC = SHA1(secret_key||message)

The server expects inputs to be in this format: {"message": message, "MAC": mac}

## Hints:

1. The message is encoded in base64
2. Appending "flag" to the message will signal the server to return the flag
3. secret_key length = 16

To begin the challenge connect to port 12065
nc [this server IP] 12065
